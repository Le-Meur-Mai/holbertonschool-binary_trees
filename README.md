Exercises on binary trees

binary_tree_node - Create a node in a binary tree

binary_tree_insert_left- Create a new node as the left child of a given node
If the given node already has a left child, the new node takes its place and
the old left child, became the left child of the new node.

binary_tree_insert_right- Create a new node as the right child of a given
node. If the given node already has a right child, the new node takes its
place and the old right child, became the right child of the new node.

binary_tree_delete- delete and free the allocated space of a binary tree.

binary_tree_is_leaf - checks if the node of a binary tree is a leaf.

binary_tree_is_root - checks if the node of a binary tree is a root.

binary_tree_preorder- Traverse a binary tree in preorder.

binary_tree_inorder- Traverse a binary tree in order.

binary_tree_postorder- Traverse a binary tree in postorder.

binary_tree_height- Calculate the height of a binary tree.

binary_tree_depth- Calculate the depth of a node in a binary tree

binary_tree_size- Give the size of a tree from a given node of a binary tree

binary_tree_leaves- Counts the number of leaves in a binary tree.

binary_tree_nodes- Calculate the number of nodes that do have at least one
child in a binary tree.

binary_tree_balance- Measure the balance factor of a binary tree.

binary_tree_is_full - checks if a binary tree is full

binary_tree_is_perfect - checks if a binary tree is perfect

binary_tree_sibling- Found the sibling of a node in a binary tree.

binary_tree_uncle- Found the uncle of a node in a binary tree.
